# hello-world
This should be my first repository
But it's alright, cause I'm finally doing it.

So..

Hello People from the World, my name is Ellen Rebeca and I'm a beginner dev.
Maybe front-end dev or fullstack dev, I didn't decided yet.

And.. that's it!! Just another "first" hello world repository. ;)
